Annealing the n-type neutron-irradiated 3C-SiC crystals at T~=~900~\degree C leads to full vanishing of silicon vacancies and simultaneous emergence of new paramagnetic defect, called Ky6. New center has spin S~=~1/2 and can be described with axial g-factor directed along <111> direction and with principal parameters g$_\parallel$~=~2.0024 and g$_\perp$~=~2.0029. Ky6 center can be observed at temperatures under 140 K and shows hyperfine interaction (HF) with principal parameters А$_\parallel$~=~23.9$\cdot$10$^{-4}$~cm$^{-1}$ and А$_\perp$~=~19.3$\cdot$10$^{-4}$~cm$^{-1}$. Based on the HF parameters, annealing processes of defects in crystal and calculations of formation energies \citep{met1,met2} center Ky6 was tentatively assigned to V\textsubscript{C}C\textsubscript{Si}\textsuperscript{0} in 3C-SiC.
